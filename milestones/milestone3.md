## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

My partner and I enjoyed learning about git management and collobration. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Something challenging my partner and I faced was pitching because it was our first time doing it and we were pretty nervous about it.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

My partner and I believe that we finished all the tasks however, if we did miss anything, we would glady fix them! 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The AI Email Summarizer and Task Prioritization features are the most at risk because they’re quite complex. If they stay at risk, we’ll focus on finishing the core features first and add simpler versions of those later.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

N/A at the moment.
